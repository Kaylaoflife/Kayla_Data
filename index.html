									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kaylaoflife/Powerbi-project">Teem superstore sales performance<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I explored sales data from Teem Superstore, diving deep into performance trends across regions, product categories, and time periods. I built an interactive Power BI report that gives stakeholders a clear picture of where sales are booming, where they’re falling short, and what can be done about it. This project showcases my ability to turn raw numbers into business-driven insights. From identifying West and East as the highest revenue-generating regions to spotting seasonal sales peaks and underperforming furniture segments, every chart and metric was chosen with a clear goal in mind: helping decision-makers act smartly. It’s a real-world example of how I use data to guide strategy, spot opportunities, and recommend solutions that drive growth.<br />

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kaylaoflife/Bank-loan-Analysis">Bank Loan Analysis<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I analyzed 23 years of loan data issued across various cities and age groups. The goal was to understand who gets approved for loans and identify any patterns or bias in the process. Younger adults (18–24) and seniors (65–100) had the highest approval rates, which raised some fairness questions. Middle-aged customers, especially those between 45 and 54, had the highest number of complaints despite lower approval rates. Though women had a slightly higher approval rate on average, men had more approved loans in most years. Auto loans recorded the highest approval rates, but mortgage loans showed steadier trends over the years. Cities like San Antonio, Mesa, Detroit, and San Jose stood out with unusual approval trends. About 33% of all feedback was complaint-related, with middle-aged users submitting the most concerns. These findings point to the need for fairer scoring systems and clearer communication with applicants. This report helps decision-makers spot gaps and improve loan strategies going forward.<br />
